tonight i feel the rhythm in the rain
echoes of the streetlights whisper your name
we dance in the dark till the morning is new
every beat of my heart is writing to you

hold on, hold on, the night will carry us home
sing on, sing on, weâ€™re never dancing alone

(chorus)
la la la, we fly above the skyline
la la la, your hand is holding mine
